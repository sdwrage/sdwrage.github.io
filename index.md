## Hello World!

While the title might seem like a redundant battle cry for any first post, I
believe it encapsulates so much more than that. A simple two letter statement
gives the reader a sense of not only the writers profession but what future posts
may be about. It is a callout that there is none before me and so many more to
hopefully come.

My name is Justin Lonas and I am a 10+ year Web Application Developer whom lives
in the active college town of Athens, OH. I have experience in developing SaaS
applications and in house applications in the realm of e-learning. I bet you are
thinking "yeah, yeah, long walks on the beach and all that... ". I am here to say
that I really love hilly hikes and babbling brooks over sand and sails; I always
have I guess.

My skills? I know the following technologies:

- Languages: PHP, Javascript, Ruby, Groovy, HTML5, CSS3, SQL
- Server-Side Frameworks: Zend Framework, Ruby on Rails, Grails
- Server-Side Tech: Apache, MySQL, Node.js, NGinx (minor), Linux Administration
- Other Tech: Vagrant, Git, AWS (EC2, S3, etc)
- Other: Writing, Good Communication (Hey Hey :D), Clean Code, Crazy (Is that a skill?)

My Hobbies?

- Programming (Are you really that surprised?)
- Art (Usually Doodling... that is art right?)
- Game design
- Music (Singing, Guitar, etc)
